This repository contains the script `run_analysis.R` which performs the following:

1. Merges the training and test datasets.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
3. Uses descriptive activity names.
4. Labels the variables appropriately.
5. Creates a tidy dataset with averages of each variable for each activity and subject.

To run:source("run_analysis.R")

The output file will be: tidyData.txt
