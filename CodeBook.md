### Description
This document describes the variables in the tidyData.txt dataset.

# Overview of the Dataset
This Dataset originates from an experiment with 30 participants aged 19-48. Each person wore a Samsung Galaxy S 2 on their waist and performed 6 exercises (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). The smartphone recorded 3-axis acceleration and 3-axis angular velocity at 50 Hz the data was split into 70 percent training and 30 percent test the raw data was filtered and divided into 2.56 second windows and features were calculated from each window using both time and frequency information

# Dataset Attributes
For each record the dataset provides 3-axis acceleration from the accelerometer including body acceleration 3-axis angular velocity from the gyroscope a 561-feature vector with time and frequency variables the activity being performed and the ID of the subject who performed it
